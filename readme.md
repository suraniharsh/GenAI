### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Dependencies Installation
1. Check the version of Node.js installed on your system using the command üõ†Ô∏è:
   ```bash
   node -v
   ```
2. Install the `ollama` package üì¶:
   ```bash
   npm install ollama
   ```
3. Verify the version of the `ollama` package üîç:
   ```bash
   ollama --version
   ```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Application Execution
1. Run the application using the command üö¶:
   ```bash
   node script.js
   ```
2. The chatbot responses will be saved in `output.json`. View the output üéâ to see the generated responses for the tasks provided in `input.json`.

## Output
- The chatbot processes tasks from the `input.json` file and saves the responses in `output.json` with the following structure:
   ```json
   {
     "categories": [
       {
         "type": "Professional Writing",
         "tasks": [
           {
             "question": "Question 1",
             "task": "Draft a formal resignation letter with a positive tone.",
             "response": "Generated response for the task."
           }
         ]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

## üõ°Ô∏è Troubleshooting
- **Error: Missing dependencies:** Ensure that `ollama` is installed correctly.
- **Error: File not found:** Verify the `input.json` file is in the correct directory.
- **Unexpected output:** Check the structure of `input.json` and ensure it matches the required format.

## üìã Notes
- Ensure you have proper permissions to read and write files in the project directory.
- Customize the tasks in `input.json` to suit your specific requirements.
